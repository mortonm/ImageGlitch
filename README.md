Description:
ImageGlitch is a simple glitch art program meant as a fun introduction to Python. It sacrifices efficiency for understandability.
It utelizes bubblesort to rearrange columns of pixels based on their blue value, leading to interesting distortion effects.

To Use:
Run imageGlitch() in the JES command area.

Suggested Improvements:
-Use a more effficient sorting algorithm
-Update the image as it corrupts each column
-Try sorting with the Red or Green value instead
-Use a different corruption technique

If you make an interesting corrupted image, I'd love to see it. Send it with an @Make With Me and use #glitchMySelfie
